# IntelliAgent - Conversational Agent Framework

## Developed with an OSS first mission, this framework builds on the growing research behind collective and collaborative agent tasking, an area where smaller, open-sourced models have the opportunity to outperform based on cost, privacy, and latency.

A central agent drives planning and delegation, while specicialized agents are tasked with delivering specifics outputs to help meet the user's queries.

Very early prototyping. Please follow for updates.

Contributions, feedback, critiques welcome!
