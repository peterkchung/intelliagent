# IntelliAgent - Conversational Agent Framework

## Developed with an OSS-first mission, this framework will build on the growing research behind collaborative agent tasking.  

Colloborative tasking is an area, where smaller, open-sourced models can outperform based on cost, privacy, and latency.

A central agent drives planning and delegation, while specicialized agents are tasked with delivering specifics outputs to help meet the user's queries.()

Very early prototyping. Please follow for updates.
