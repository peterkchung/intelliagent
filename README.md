### Logos (λόγος): A Greek term used by philosophers meaning "word," "speech," or "reason." In the context of philosophy, it refers to the principle of order and knowledge.

Logos is an orchestration framework for planning, organizing, and executing tasks with language models (LMs).

Very early prototyping. Please follow for updates.

Contributions, feedback, critiques welcome!
