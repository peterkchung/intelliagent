# IntelliAgent - Conversational Assistants

## Driven by open-sourced models, platforms, and frameworks.

Developed with an OSS first mission. This framework builds on the growing research behind collective and collaborative agent tasking.

A central agent drives planning and delegation, while  specicialized agents are tasked with delivering specifics outputs to help meet the user's queries.

Very early prototyping. Please follow for updates.

Contributions, feedback, critiques welcome!
